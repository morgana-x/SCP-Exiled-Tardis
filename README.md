# Work in progress

Currently can only exit and reenter the tardis with very basic stuff, interior is just one of those towers admins use currently

I am away for 2 weeks so this won't receive any updates until then, I think it's somewhat usable now, apart from the dodgy interior.

# How to use:

Press E on the buttons in the main console and figure out what they do

# Planned features:

Interior Redesign ( It will take all day to make in pure code :pensive:)

Better navigation gameplay, more complexity

Proper fading effect

Better Gamebalance / Gameplay mechanics

More buttons :)
