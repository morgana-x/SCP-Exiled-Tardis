Exiled plugin that adds the tardis from doctor who

Work in progress, for exiled 7.0.0

Currently can only exit and reenter the tardis with very basic stuff, interior is just one of those towers admins use currently


Planned features:

Better navigation gameplay, so far it's just guess the button

Proper fading effect

Game balance maybe (Currently just have a cooldown on teleporting and a check to see if a player is obstructing where its going)

Config for who can enter tardis (Maybe a door locking system so its a viable escape from scps!)
