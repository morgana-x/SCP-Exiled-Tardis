Exiled plugin that adds the tardis from doctor who

Work in progress, for exiled 7.0.0

Currently can only exit and reenter the tardis with very basic stuff, interior is just one of those towers admins use currently

How to use:

Press E on the buttons in the main console and figure out what they do

Planned features:

Better navigation gameplay, more complexity

Proper fading effect

Better Gamebalance / Gameplay mechanics

Config for who can enter tardis (Maybe a door locking system so its a viable escape from scps!)
