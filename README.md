Exiled plugin that adds the tardis from doctor who


Work in progress, for exiled 7.0.0

Currently can only exit and reenter the tardis with very basic stuff, interior is just one of those towers admins use currently

All players will also teleport to the tardis on spawn for debug purposes, this is not meant to actually be used on a server yet

Planned features:

Move the tardis to different locations

Proper fading effect

Game balance maybe

Config for who can enter tardis (Maybe a door locking system so its a viable escape from scps!)

(Hopefully all this can be done from the central console thingy in the interior of the tardis with buttons some which way)
