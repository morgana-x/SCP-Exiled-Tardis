Exiled plugin that adds the tardis from doctor who


Work in progress, for exiled 7.0.0

Currently can only exit and reenter the tardis with very basic stuff, interior is just one of those towers admins use currently

Planned features:
Move the tardis to different locations
Proper fading effect
Game balance maybe
Config for who can enter tardis (Maybe a door locking system so its a viable escape from scps!)
